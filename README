# Real-Time Weather Application

This is a real-time weather application that fetches weather data from an API and displays it to the user. The application allows users to search for weather information based on their desired location. It utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve the weather data.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Project Steps

1. **Set up the HTML structure:**
   - Create an HTML file with a basic structure.
   - Add necessary elements like input fields, buttons, and containers to display the weather information.

2. **Style the UI:**
   - Use CSS to style the elements and make the application visually appealing.
   - Design the layout, colors, and typography according to your preference.

3. **Fetch weather data from the API:**
   - Register for an API key from OpenWeatherMap (https://openweathermap.org/).
   - Write JavaScript code to fetch weather data from the API using the Fetch API or XMLHttpRequest.
   - Use the API key and the user's input (location) to construct the API URL.
   - Handle the API response and parse the JSON data.

4. **Display weather information:**
   - Create functions to update the DOM with the weather data.
   - Dynamically generate HTML elements to display the current weather conditions, temperature, humidity, etc.
   - Update the UI with the retrieved data by manipulating the DOM.

5. **Handle user interactions:**
   - Add event listeners to the search button or input field to trigger the weather data fetching process.
   - Validate user input and handle error cases like invalid locations or failed API requests.
   - Provide appropriate feedback or error messages to the user.

6. **Test the application:**
   - Test the application with different locations and verify that the weather data is displayed correctly.
   - Check for any bugs or issues and make necessary adjustments.
